This is a simple Flask-based API for user authentication, including signup and login functionalities. It uses SQLite for data storage and bcrypt for password hashing.

## Features

- **Signup:** Register a new user with a username, password, and email.
- **Login:** Authenticate a user with a username and password.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- bcrypt
- SQLite (included in Python standard library)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create the database and tables:

Run the following command to ensure that the database and the required table are created:

bash
Copy code
python database.py
This will also add a sample user to the database.

Run the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The server will start at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
